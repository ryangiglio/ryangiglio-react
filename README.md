# Hello!

This is the source code for my personal website, [ryangiglio.com](http://ryangiglio.com).

## FAQ

##### Q: Seriously? You get Frequent Questions about your website?
A: No, I just wanted a good format to tell you some stuff.

##### Q: How was this project built?
A: It's a React.js app, scaffolded by the [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) CLI tool. I've read enough "getting started with Webpack" tutorials to understand how to set up my own dev environment, but I'd rather let Facebook do it.

##### Q: Why did you use React to build a static website?
A: Because it seemed like a good way to prove to myself (and the world!) that I understand the basics. Obviously I realize it's hilariously overkill, but the structure and concepts are still relevant.

##### Q: Why is it so plain looking?
A: *Hey! I like it!* I don't pretend to be a designer, so I tried to come up with a concept that would work with just text. It's supposed to feel like a Choose Your Own Adventure game. All the styles are from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If you want to see what pretty little trees I can paint with CSS, feel free to check out some of the stuff on the [work page](http://ryangiglio.com/work) ;)
